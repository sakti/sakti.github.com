						<p>
						Indo Cisc Founded in late 1999, PT. Indo Cisc is one of the first established IT consultant companies in Indonesia. We are focus on network, computer, and application security evaluation. The original name of the company is "Community Communication Integrated System (CCIS)", but CISC sounds better. We are not big in any sizes and we are not worldwide. This makes us distinguish from other IT security companies.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						Our small team is composed of trusted technical people. People with integrity. We are not a group of crackers! None of our team has been involved with cracking, and never will. We do not hire crackers. We have to guarantee the secrecy of confidential information when we perform services for our clients. Individuals behind INDO CISC are prominent Internet figures in Indonesia who have been involved with the Internet since 1987. Our investors include Budi Rahardjo (a prominent Internet figure in Indonesia).

						<h1><center>Methodology</center></h1>
						<p>
						INDO CISC approaches its consultating services and training programme as a whole, taking into account the best practices methodology. Therefore, when evaluating/assessing one's system security we count on standard methodology such as OSSTMM (Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual) and our own methodology, "INDO CISC Security Evaluation Checklist."
						</p>
						
						<p>
						We believe that best practice approaches can give fast and reliable solutions to the problem arises during assessment. We also apply this best practice approach on our security training. We emphasize the theory behind system security with hands-on tutorial through the class room.
