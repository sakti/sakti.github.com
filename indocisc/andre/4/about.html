						<h1><center>About Us</center></h1>
						<p>
						Indo Cisc Founded in late 1999, PT. Indo Cisc is one of the first established IT consultant companies in Indonesia. We are focus on
						network, computer, and application security evaluation. The original name of the company is "Community Communication Integrated System (CCIS
						", but CISC sounds better. We are not big in any sizes and we are not worldwide. This makes us distinguish from other IT security companies.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						Our small team is composed of trusted technical people. People with integrity. We are not a group of crackers! None of our team has been
						involved with cracking, and never will. We do not hire crackers. We have to guarantee the secrecy of confidential information when we
						perform services for our clients. Individuals behind INDO CISC are prominent Internet figures in Indonesia who have been involved with the
						Internet since 1987. Our investors include Budi Rahardjo (a prominent Internet figure in Indonesia).

								Our focus (or obsession) is in community's communication. That is providing technology to make us communicate better. We believe
								that the purpose of technology is to make our lives better and make this world a better place to live. The original name of the
								company is "Community Communication Integrated System (CCIS)", but CISC sounds better. Our vision of community's communication
								includes internet hosting, (hard and soft) infrastructure, and security. To provide the best technology, we are starting 
								(technology) incubators. All of this is reflected in services and companies we invested.
