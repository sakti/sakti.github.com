					<h3>Methodology</h3>
					<p>
						 INDO CISC approaches its consultating services and training programme as a whole, taking into account the best practices methodology. Therefore, when evaluating/assessing oneï¿½s system security we count on standard methodology such as OSSTMM (Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual) and our own methodology, "INDO CISC Security Evaluation Checklist."
					</p>
					<p>
						We believe that best practice approaches can give fast and reliable solutions to the problem arises during assessment. We also apply this best practice approach on our security training. We emphasize the theory behind system security with hands-on tutorial through the class room.
